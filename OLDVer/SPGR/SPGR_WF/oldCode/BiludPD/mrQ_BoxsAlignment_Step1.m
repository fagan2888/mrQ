%the PD fit of each brain box need to be combined with the rest.
% all the boxes have a mean value of about 1
% that means that in order to combine the boxes (each might have a differet
% mean depend on where it is in the brain), we need to find a scalre to
% multipe each of the boxes.
% to find that will use the fact that there is overlap between the boxs so
% a scalre between each two overlap box can be calculate.
% when the box are scaled substracting two overlap region of two boxes
% should eqal to 1.
% we will use this idea
% we will build a matrix that estimate that have all the scalaer that used
% to and substract each two overlap box so it addes to zeros
%this matix can be soveld as alinear eqation system if one box set to be
%one.
%this box will be could the Reference box
% this function build a matrix mat that will alow us to estimate the scalre
% parameter of each box using this eqation
%  mat*C=y
% y is zeors (box X 1) vector with a single 1 in the reference box location
% mat is the eqtions of substract the niboring part of the boxs
% C is the scals of the box (that we will try to estimate globaly)
%
%we will loop over the boxes. and esine the values in the matrixes above in three step
%with three nested function  mrQ_getBoxsdat.
% 1. a functioon that load the box information and data and fits
% 2. we will find the feel the reference box values and it nighbors for
% the matrixes. mrQ_AvrageBox_reference
% 3. then we will add all the other boxes and nigbers. mrQ_getBoxsdat
