We are developing quantitative MRI tools to understand white matter and cerebral cortex.

These tools were initiated by Aviv Mezer and then edited by Michael Perry.  

Wandell is also editing the tools, particularly relating to corrections for coil gain 
and measuring PD.

Directories:

PD  -  See this directory for scripts to eliminate coil gain and measure proton density.  Measuring
proton density is a key step to calculate tissue properties.  Once we have PD accurately assessed, 
we can interpret T1 using biophysical models from Mezer et al.
