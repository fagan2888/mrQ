function  [est, polyRatioMat] = polySolveRatio(r,pBasis)
% Solve for the gain parameters of the polynomial coefficient

%  est = polySolveRatio(r,pBasis)
%
% r:  A matrix whose columns are the M0 data at the (x,y,z)
%     positions (or x,y, or x). The ratios of these values in these columns
%     scale the pMatrix.  If there are P position and N coils this matrix
%     is P x N.
% pMatrix:  The matrix of polynomial basis functions over positions
%
% est:           The estimated gains
% polyRatioMat:  The large matrix such that 0 = polyRatioMat * gains
