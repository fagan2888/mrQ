%% The rows of polyRatioMat are ratios of M0 measurements
%
%  These measurements are from two coils at a voxel.
%  We could scale the row to reflect the SNR of that ratio.
%  For example, if one of the M0 values is small, that would reduce our
%  confidence in the ratio.
%
% Note, we have a lot of coil and voxels.  So we can get rid of quite a few
% (even zeroing them out) and still solve this equation.

%% I am concerned that the gain coefficients are so different in size
%
% The DC coefficient is 1000 times bigger than the other ones.  
% In fact, they decline precipitously across order.  So, maybe we should be
% doing something to balance these better.
%% We could re-write the M0 matrix to represent virtual coils
%
%  Each column of M0 is a real coil.  If we analyze the 

% Solve for the eigenvectors of polyRatioMat.  The first one has the
% smallest singular value and is thus the best estimate of the solution to
% the equation 0 = polyRatioMat * g
%
%  
[U, ~] = eig(polyRatioMat'*polyRatioMat);
 
% % We scale the gain vector so that the first entry of the first coil
% % estimate (the constant) is 1.
